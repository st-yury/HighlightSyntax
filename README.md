C# Syntax Highlighter

A lightweight script designed to colorize keywords in small C# code snippets for use in HTML pages.

This is an initial development versionâ€”functionality is limited, and it may contain bugs. Currently, it only processes valid C# code correctly.

Usage: Paste your C# code snippet, then copy the formatted output directly into your HTML page.
